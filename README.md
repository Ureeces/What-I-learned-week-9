## 2D Arrays

In essence, a 2D array is an array of arrays.

It is possible to access the indicis of the arrays within the bigger array, using loops and smart variable names.

### FS

Using fs, it is possible to import file data and convert it to a single string.

This is extremely useful, as it is relatively simple and makes it much easier to convert to more usable format (Using loops to separate into rows in a 2D array)

### Callbacks

It is possible to execute Javascript functions at different intervals rather than immediately. These are callbacks. 

You can set intervals at which commands will execute every xth-measure-of-time, as well as clear those intervals.
